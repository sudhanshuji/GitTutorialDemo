Issue -: Issues are discussion threads where people can report bugs, request features or even just ask questions.

Pull Requests -: Pull requests let you show others the change you are proposing. So that they can review and discuss them.

On Github every one has a copy of the project. SO if anyone having any idea for something more better idea, It can be added to a saperate branch .

Github keeps a record of everyone contribution and feedback.

Once the new feature is developed it is deployed to the main branch and now the new feature is available to everyone.

Branch -: An alternate timeline where changes can be made without effecting the working of already running codes.

Git -:

Git is a version control system
	-> easily recover falls
	-> who introduced an issue and why
	-> Rollback to previously working state
	
History of Version Control System-:

Local Version Control System -> keep track of file in your local machine
	
	Pros -> Can track files and rollback.
	
	Cons -> If HardDisk is lost then everything gone.
	
Centralized Version Control System -> A central server is maintained from where everyone pulls the code and push it there after changes.

Distributed version control system -> A central server is maintained from where an individual copy(A mirror of original repository) is provided to each members of the team.

Features of Git-:

	-> It captures the snapshot not the differences.
	
	-> Almost every operation is local.
	
	-> Git has Integrity.(It calculates the checksum of each file and when anything is changed inside the originual file then checksum of the modified file is changed.)
